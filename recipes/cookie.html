    <h2>~Description~</h2>
    <p><em>Chocolate chip cookies are classic, chewy treats made by creaming together butter and sugar, then mixing in eggs, vanilla, flour, and baking soda. Semi-sweet chocolate chips are folded into the dough before scooping and baking until golden brown. The result is a soft, slightly crisp cookie with melty chocolate pockets and a rich, buttery flavor.</em></p><br>

            <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong><p>Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F). Line a baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong><p>In a medium bowl, whisk together:
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Flour</li>
                    <li>Baking Soda</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                </ul>
                <br>Set it aside.
            </p></li>
            <li><strong>Cream butter and sugars:</strong><p>In a large bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer to beat together butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar.<br>Beat on medium speed for 2-3 minutes until light and creamy.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Add eggs and vanilla:</strong><p>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Add the vanilla extract and beat until fully combined.</p></li>
            <li><strong> Add dry ingredients:</strong><p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed or by hand until just combined. Don’t overmix.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Fold in chocolate chips:</strong><p>Using a spatula, fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Shape the cookies:</strong><p>Scoop dough using a tablespoon or cookie scoop. Roll into balls and place them 2 inches apart on the prepared baking tray.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Bake!</strong><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 10–12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden but the centers still look slightly soft.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Let it cool down:</strong><p>Let the cookies cool on the tray for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</p></li>
